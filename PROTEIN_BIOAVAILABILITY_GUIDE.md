# Protein Bioavailability & Absorption Guide

## 🧬 Understanding Protein Quality

### What is Protein Bioavailability?
**Bioavailability** = How much of the protein your body can actually absorb and use for building muscle and other functions.

## 🎯 ADJUSTED PROTEIN TARGETS

### Original Targets (Assuming 100% Absorption)
- **Person 1 (22M):** 150g protein daily
- **Person 2 (46F):** 70g protein daily
- **Person 3 (50M):** 95g protein daily

### Adjusted Targets (Accounting for Plant Protein Bioavailability)

Given our diet is **~40% animal protein (eggs, dairy, whey)** and **~60% plant protein (dals, besan, nuts)**:

**Average absorption rate:** (0.4 × 100%) + (0.6 × 70%) = 40% + 42% = **~82% overall**

#### NEW ADJUSTED TARGETS (to compensate for lower absorption):

| Person | Original Target | Adjustment Factor | **NEW Target (on paper)** | **Absorbed Protein** |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Person 1** | 150g | ÷ 0.82 | **183g** | ~150g absorbed |
| **Person 2** | 70g | ÷ 0.82 | **85g** | ~70g absorbed |
| **Person 3** | 95g | ÷ 0.82 | **116g** | ~95g absorbed |

**Translation:** We need to aim for **~20-25% MORE protein on paper** to account for incomplete absorption from plant sources.

## 🔧 STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE PLANT PROTEIN ABSORPTION

### 1. **Sprouting Legumes**
- Increases bioavailability from 65% → 75-80%
- Reduces antinutrients (phytates, lectins)
- **Action:** Use sprouts 2-3x per week

### 2. **Combine Incomplete Proteins**
- Rice + Dal = Complete protein (complementary amino acids)
- Wheat + Chickpeas = Complete protein
- **Action:** Already doing this with khichdi!

### 3. **Add Vitamin C to Meals**
- Enhances iron and protein absorption from plant sources
- **Action:** Lemon juice on salads, citrus fruits with meals

### 4. **Reduce Phytates (Antinutrients)**
- Soak dals overnight before cooking
- Ferment grains (e.g., idli/dosa batter)
- **Action:** Soak rajma, chana for 8-12 hours

### 5. **Cook Legumes Properly**
- Pressure cooking reduces antinutrients
- Adds turmeric (enhances absorption)
- **Action:** Already doing this!

### 6. **Distribute Protein Throughout Day**
- Body can only absorb ~30-40g protein per meal optimally
- **Action:** 6 meals per day strategy (already implemented)

### 7. **Pair with Healthy Fats**
- Helps with fat-soluble vitamin absorption (A, D, E, K)
- Slows digestion for better amino acid uptake
- **Action:** Ghee, nuts, olive oil in meals

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED

### For Days 1, 2, 3 Meal Plans:

#### Person 1:
- ✅ Already hitting ~165-175g on paper → **~140-145g absorbed** (slightly low)
- **Add:** 1 more whole egg OR 3 more egg whites daily
- **Add:** Increase paneer portions by 20g
- **Target on paper:** 185g

#### Person 2:
- ✅ Currently hitting ~90-99g on paper → **~72-75g absorbed** (GOOD!)
- No major changes needed
- **Target on paper:** 90g

#### Person 3:
- ⚠️ Currently hitting ~88-95g on paper → **~70-75g absorbed** (TOO LOW!)
- **Add:** 2-3 more egg whites per day
- **Add:** Increase dal portions by 30g
- **Consider:** Increase whey to 1 scoop (if acceptable for heart health)
- **Target on paper:** 115-120g

---

## 🧪 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: DAY 1 PERSON 1

### Original Calculation (Naive):
- Total protein on paper: 150g
- Assumed absorbed: 150g

### Realistic Calculation (Bioavailability-Adjusted):

| Source | Amount | Absorption | Absorbed |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| Whey | 36g | 100% | 36g |
| Eggs | 32g | 100% | 32g |
| Paneer | 10g | 90% | 9g |
| Curd/Milk | 12g | 90% | 11g |
| **Animal Subtotal** | **90g** | - | **88g** |
| Dals (rajma, moong) | 37g | 70% | 26g |
| Oats | 11g | 65% | 7g |
| Nuts | 6g | 75% | 4.5g |
| Vegetables | 6g | 60% | 3.5g |
| **Plant Subtotal** | **60g** | - | **41g** |
| **TOTAL** | **150g** | - | **129g** ⚠️ |

**Result:** Only absorbing ~129g instead of target 150g!

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: REVISED DAY 1 PERSON 1

Add these adjustments:
- **+2 egg whites** (14g protein) → 14g absorbed
- **+20g paneer** (4g protein) → 3.6g absorbed
- **+20g dal** (5g protein) → 3.5g absorbed

**New Total Absorbed:** 129 + 14 + 3.6 + 3.5 = **150.1g ✅**

---

## 📚 KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Plant proteins are 65-75% bioavailable** vs. animal proteins at 95-100%
2. **Aim for 20-25% MORE protein on paper** when using plant sources
3. **Prioritize animal proteins** (eggs, whey, dairy) for efficiency
4. **Use strategies** (sprouting, combining, soaking) to improve plant protein absorption
5. **Track "absorbed protein"** not just "protein on paper"
6. **Person 3 needs the most attention** due to egg yolk restrictions + heart health

---

## 🎯 ACTION ITEMS FOR MEAL PLANS

### Immediate Changes:
1. ✅ Person 1: Add 2-3 more egg whites daily (boost to 6-7 whites total)
2. ⚠️ Person 3: Add 3-4 more egg whites daily (boost to 8-10 whites total)
3. 💡 All: Use sprouts 3-4x per week (higher bioavailability)
4. 💡 All: Ensure vitamin C at every meal (lemon, amla, citrus)
5. 💡 All: Soak dals overnight before cooking

### Recipe Modifications:
- Increase dal portions by 20-30g across all meals
- Add extra egg whites to breakfast dishes
- Include paneer 4-5x per week (not just 2-3x)
- Use hung curd (Greek yogurt) more frequently
- Add sprouts to 3-4 meals per week
